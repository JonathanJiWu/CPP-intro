			//# Inline fucntion
			// When the program executes the function call instruction the CPU stores the memory address of the instruction following the function call, 
			// copies the arguments of the function on the stack and finally transfers control to the specified function. 
			// The CPU then executes the function code, stores the function return value in a predefined memory location/register and returns control to the calling function. 
			// This can become overhead if the execution time of function is less than the switching time from the caller function to called function (callee). 
			// For functions that are large and/or perform complex tasks, the overhead of the function call is usually insignificant compared to the amount of time the function takes to run. 
			// However, for small, commonly-used functions, the time needed to make the function call is often a lot more than the time needed to actually execute the function’s code. 
			// This overhead occurs for small functions because execution time of small function is less than the switching time.
			// 
			//reduce the function call overhead, only a request to the compiler
			// 
			// Only when you want the function to be defined in a header
			//if you define a function in a header you will need to declare it inline. Otherwise you will get linker errors about multiple definitions of the function.

			//# const function
			//The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are called. or call any non-const member functions (as they may modify the object).
			//When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object. Non-const functions can only be called by non-const objects. 
			//const class objects can only explicitly call const member functions
			//append the const keyword to the function prototype, after the parameter list, but before the function body:
			int getValue() const { return m_value; } // note addition of const keyword after parameter list, but before function body
			//Best practice: Make any member function that does not modify the state of the class object const, so that it can be called by const objects.

			//# Pass by lvalue reference: passing a class argument by value causes a copy of the class to be made (which is slow) -- most of the time, we don’t need a copy, 
			//a reference to the original argument works just fine, and is more performant because it avoids the needless copy. 
			//We typically make the reference const in order to ensure the function does not inadvertently change the argument, and to allow the function to work with R-values (e.g. literals), 
			//which can be passed as const references, but not non-const references.
			void printValue(std::string& y) // type changed to std::string&
			{
				std::cout << y << '\n';
			} // y is destroyed here

			int main()
			{
				std::string x{ "Hello, world!" };

				printValue(x); // x is now passed by reference into reference parameter y (inexpensive)

				return 0;
			}
			//the type of parameter y has been changed from std::string to std::string& (an lvalue reference).
			//Now, when printValue(x) is called, lvalue reference parameter y is bound to argument x.
			//Binding a reference is always inexpensive, and no copy of x needs to be made.
			//Because a reference acts as an alias for the object being referenced, when printValue() uses reference y, it’s accessing the actual argument x(rather than a copy of x).

				char c3{ val2 };  // error: possible narrowing (good)
