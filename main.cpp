			//# Inline fucntion
			// When the program executes the function call instruction the CPU stores the memory address of the instruction following the function call, 
			// copies the arguments of the function on the stack and finally transfers control to the specified function. 
			// The CPU then executes the function code, stores the function return value in a predefined memory location/register and returns control to the calling function. 
			// This can become overhead if the execution time of function is less than the switching time from the caller function to called function (callee). 
			// For functions that are large and/or perform complex tasks, the overhead of the function call is usually insignificant compared to the amount of time the function takes to run. 
			// However, for small, commonly-used functions, the time needed to make the function call is often a lot more than the time needed to actually execute the function’s code. 
			// This overhead occurs for small functions because execution time of small function is less than the switching time.
			// 
			//reduce the function call overhead, only a request to the compiler
			// 
			// Only when you want the function to be defined in a header
			//if you define a function in a header you will need to declare it inline. Otherwise you will get linker errors about multiple definitions of the function.

			//# const function
			//The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are called. or call any non-const member functions (as they may modify the object).
			//When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object. Non-const functions can only be called by non-const objects. 
			//const class objects can only explicitly call const member functions
			//append the const keyword to the function prototype, after the parameter list, but before the function body:
			int getValue() const { return m_value; } // note addition of const keyword after parameter list, but before function body
			//Best practice: Make any member function that does not modify the state of the class object const, so that it can be called by const objects.

			//# Pass by lvalue reference: passing a class argument by value causes a copy of the class to be made (which is slow) -- most of the time, we don’t need a copy, 
			//a reference to the original argument works just fine, and is more performant because it avoids the needless copy. 
			//We typically make the reference const in order to ensure the function does not inadvertently change the argument, and to allow the function to work with R-values (e.g. literals), 
			//which can be passed as const references, but not non-const references.
			void printValue(std::string& y) // type changed to std::string&

				std::cout << y << '\n';

			int main()

				printValue(x); // x is now passed by reference into reference parameter y (inexpensive)

				return 0;
			}
			//the type of parameter y has been changed from std::string to std::string& (an lvalue reference).
			//Now, when printValue(x) is called, lvalue reference parameter y is bound to argument x.
			//Binding a reference is always inexpensive, and no copy of x needs to be made.
			//Because a reference acts as an alias for the object being referenced, when printValue() uses reference y, it’s accessing the actual argument x(rather than a copy of x).

			//5.3 Modulus and exponentiation
			//modulus operator returns the reminder after the int division, only works with int operands, test if a num is evenly divisible by another num
			//#include <cmath> header pow(num, num1) is exponents, same level of arithmetic precedence, left to right if in one expression

			//5.4 increment/ decrement operators, side effects

			//x++	Copy x, then increment x, then return the copy postfix, copy
			int x{ 5 };
			int y = ++x; // x is incremented to 6, x is evaluated to the value 6, and 6 is assigned to y

			int x{ 5 };
			int y = x++; // x is incremented to 6, copy of original x is evaluated to the value 5, and 5 is assigned to y

			int x{ 5 };

			std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n';
			std::cout << x++ << ' ' << y-- << '\n'; // postfix, 6 4, the copy of x and y sent to cout
			std::cout << x << ' ' << y << '\n'; // postfix x and y are evaluated again, changed from last line, 7 3

			//best practic: favor prefix version, more performant, less issues

			//# side effect: a function or expression that does anything that persists beyond the life of function or expression itself
			x = 5; // the assignment operator modifies the state of x, or: side effect or changing the value of x, after the statement has finished evaluating
			++x; // operator++ modifies the state of x
			std::cout << x; // operator<< modifies the state of the console

			//unexpected results: 
			int add(int x, int y)
			{
				return x + y;
			}
			int x{ 5 };
			int value{ add(x, ++x) };// 5 + 6, or 6 + 6 It depends on what order your compiler evaluates the function arguments in
			std::cout << value << '\n'; // value could be 11 or 12, depending on how the above line evaluates!

			//5.5 comma and conditional operators, allows evaluate multiple expression with one expression, left operand and then right, then return

			z = (a, b); // evaluate (a, b) first to get result of b, then assign that value to variable z.
			z = a, b; // evaluates as "(z = a), b", so z gets assigned the value of a, and b is evaluated and discarded.
			//best practice: avoid using comma

			c ? x : y; // If c is nonzero(true) then evaluate x, otherwise evaluate y

			//avoid doing ==,!= with floating point operands


			//5.7 logical operators
			//!, &&, ||, true, false
			//! //! x > y actually evaluates as (!x) > y
			//! 
			//|| => eigher or both, inclusive or, || is the logical OR operator, it returns true if either of the operands is true
			//&& => both, return false immediately if the first one is false, without evaluating the second one
			//called SHORT CIRCUIT EVALUATION, similarly if first operand for || is true, also return true immediately without evaluating second one
			
			//mixing && and ||
			//&& has higher precedence than ||, use parenthesizes to avoid bugs
			
			//De Morgan's laws:
			//!(x && y) == (!x || !y)
			//! (x || y) == (!x && !y)
			//according to the truth table, not x or y is logically equivalent to not x or not y
			
			//exclusive OR: (XOR), both can not be satisfied at the same time
			//C++ doesn't have a built-in XOR operator, logical XOR cannot be short circuit evaluated
			//C++11 introduced the std::bit_xor function, which can be used to implement XOR

			if (aaa != bbb) {};// aaa XOR bbb

			//6.0 compound statements/blocks
			//block of statement that is treated as a a single statement by the compiler
			//begin with {, and ends with }, can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed, no semicolon is needed
			
			//# blocks inside of other blocks
			//functions can't be nested inside other functions, but blocks can nested inside other blocks(outer block, inner block)
			
			//execute blocks conditionally(if statements)
			//if statement executes a single statement/block of statements if the condition evaluates to true
			
			//# NESTING LEVEL/NESTING DEPTH
			//C++ supports 256 levels of nesting, Visual Studio supports 100 ~ 110
			//BEST PRACTICE: keep nesting level of the function to 3 or less, refactor into subfunctions if need more levels

			//6.2 USER DEFINED NAMESPACES & SCOPE RESOLUTION OPERATOR
